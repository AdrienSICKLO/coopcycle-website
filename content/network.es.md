        <h4 class="h4">Funding : against the capitalist rentier effect, we contribute !</h4>
        <p>The pooled services are funded by cotisation. The cotisation rate and the funds gathered are democratically managed by members. Thus, the couriers get back the control over their professional activity and working tools.</p>
        <h4 class="h4">A democratic governance</h4>
        <p>Couriers decide together about:
            <ul>
                <li>The contribution's level of everyone according to its juridical status  (cooperative, association, institutionnal entity)</li>
                <li>The funds allocation</li>
                <li>The pay scheme to provide services</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The cooperative statuses for CoopCycle member enforces as well a democratic governance at the local level.

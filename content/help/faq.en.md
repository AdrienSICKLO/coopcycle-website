#### What is CoopCycle?

**CoopCycle** is above all an **open-source software** to run a logistics platform, with usage restrictions through its [license](http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License).
In a few words, **you have to be organized as a worker-owned co-op to run it**.
The idea is that the platform is a common good, which means it belongs to no one, and at the same time it belongs to everybody.

It is also a **political tool**: we are advocating against uberization through articles and conferences, we are building an alternative economic model to the foodtech giants and we are federating a community of couriers in several cities of France and Belgium to push them to seize this political and technological tool that is CoopCycle.

#### How is it pronounced?

It is pronounced **[koʊˌɑp saɪkəl]**
As you may have guessed, the first four letters mean « co-op », so please do not say **[kuːp]**

#### I am a foodtech worker, what would be the benefits of Coopcycle?

Co-ops allow workers to enjoy all the benefits of being employed combined with those of independence. We believe that foodtech workers should have stable income and protection (accident, illness, paid leave…). As co-operators, workers take part in the technical and commercial decisions.

#### I am a restaurant-owner, what would be the benefits of using Coopcycle?

Depending on country legislation, restaurant owners & shopkeepers would have the opportunity to regain control by **being associated to the decision making**.
For example, they (couriers and restaurant owners) could decide hand-in-hand a fair commission price.

#### Are you a startup?

**No**, right now we are an non-profit organization, we are working on the creation of a co-op.

#### Is it ready? Can I order meals on your platform?

**Not yet.**
The code to run the platform is [actively developed](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/pulse/monthly). But the code is only a small part of the project: we are working hard to make it real in France and gathering with collectives who want to launch their own co-op!
However, you can already have an overview of the user interface (customer and restaurant) on our [demo website](https://demo.coopcycle.org/en/)

**If you are speaking about the software**

We are targeting a launch in spring 2018.
The more contributors, the faster the project will be operational.
However, the association that carries the project wants to properly structure the software, its modalities of use and governance.

**If you want to start working as a co-operator**

Foodtech workers are gathering into new kind of unions in every major city.
This is a good starting point! Join or create your city's union and send us an email, we are here to facilitate.

**If you want to deliver your products in an equitable way**

Contact your city's bikers collective and/or send us an email, we are here to facilitate.

**If you want to order a meal**

More informations about your city are coming soon…

#### I am citizen, journalist, developer, economist… How can I contribute?

Coopcycle is a common, so everybody can contribute :)
If you want to take part in the software development, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dev@coopcycle.org">dev@coopcycle.org</a>.
We are also interested in help of any kind : business development, communication,sociology, economy, aso. - feel free to reach us at <a href="mailto:contact@coopcycle.org">contact@coopcycle.org</a>.

#### Are you using blockchain?

**No**, we are not using blockchain, but standard web technologies.
Of course, we are definitely interested in blockchain and all the possibilities it brings in terms of decentralization & ownership.
But we think we don't need to use blockchain to achieve decentralization.
We want to allow as many developers as possible to contribute, from experts to newbies.
